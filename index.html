        <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Lehigh University and pursuing a minor in Philosophy. 
             I am facinated in how things worked. In distinguishing between the gadgets that 
             I like and those that passed by the wayside, I want to know how they work so I could improve them and make them my own. 
             This pssion drove me to pursue an education in Computer Engineering</p>
     <div></div>
            <p>As often as I explore how devices work I like to explore how the world works. 
            The meaning in life, the value of things and what is right and wrong are all topics I enjoy reading about.
             For this reason I am pursuing a minor in philosophy. Please refer to the page on philosophy for more detail.</p>
