                                Born in Charlotte North Carolina in 1996 I was a very quiet kid as my parents were imigrants
                                from Poland. As a boy I enjoyed spending time outside playing various sports, but my pation
                                for electronics and computers came much later in high school.

                          <h2>Life at Lehigh</h2>
                          <p>I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Lehigh University and pursuing a minor in Philosophy. 
                                     I am facinated in how things work. In distinguishing between the gadgets that 
                                     I like and those that passed by the wayside, I want to know how they work so I could improve them and make them my own. 
                                     This passion drove me to pursue an education in Computer Engineering</p>
